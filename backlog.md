##### Week Two
* Decided to create an app that allows users to convert 
numbers between Number Systems (Decimal -> Binary, Binary -> Decimal
etc.)
* The UI will be broken up into 2 main section:
    * Top section will feature the result of the conversion as well
    the input by the user
    * Bottom section will feature a keypad where the user can enter
    the number he/she wishes to convert, as well as choose which
    number system to convert into
   
* Subtasks required to complete the project:
    1. Design and Implement keypad for different number system
    2. Switch keypads when user changes number sytems
    3. Display entered number by user in top section of the screen
    4. Convert number entered in real-time and display it in the center
    of the top section of the screen
    
Time spent: ~ 2hrs.
